Inspired by Andrej Karpathy's Neural Network Zero to Hero, this project consist making of a character level language model. It begins with a bigram character-level language model. The series covers torch.Tensor, MLP models, deep network internals, Batch Normalization, and progresses to a WaveNet-like structure. It explores torch.nn, deep learning concepts, and the development process. Overall, it's a comprehensive journey from fundamental concepts to complex neural network architectures.
